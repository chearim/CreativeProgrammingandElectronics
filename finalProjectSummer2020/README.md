**Enticing Description**

If you love nature but don't have a green thumb, you might need the help of Ada, my smart planter. She uses data from a soil moisture sensor and a temperature sensor to determine if your plant needs more sunlight, water, or the opposite. The different animated faces are what cue the user of your plant's status. The name Ada is a tribute to the adafruit library and Ada Lovelace.

**Materials**
- oled display (168 * 64) 
- soil moisutre sensor 
- temperature sensor 

**Challenges**

I think the most challenging part was constructing the planter so that no water is able to get into it while the plant is being watered. To make sure that doesn't happen, I braided all of the wires to organize them and wrapped the bottom of the planter in a plastic baggie. I also made an outer protective layer with cardboard and foil to make sure it doesn't spill in from the sides.
