**Description of Project**

During quarantine, I have recently picked up an old hobby: piano. I have been enjoying playing again so much that I decided to make an ultrasonic one along with a metronome. This way I can even play at my desk :) !

To turn on the instrument, I installed a switch that stays on or off. Once turned on, a metronome made of a medal chopstick and a glass cup starts to make a beat. I then press a button to start playing the piano.

**Challenges**

It was interesting to work with an ultrasonic sensor and have the ability to create my own piano with varying key widths. I also found it a little difficult to code without using delay() but millis() came in handy. I also had trouble with articulation while playing songs but adding a button that I can control with my let hand made it easier to get the sound right.
