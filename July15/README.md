# Game (The Journey) 

Recently, I came across a mobile game called Sky Children and fell in love with the story and graphics. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

With a twist of my own, I programmed a game that has that same serene nature to it. As you can tell, my character was laregly based off of the sky children. My other inspiration was the Google Dinosaur game.

Here are some character designs that I also made.

For this game, I ended up going with the second one. 


**Challenges**

This was the first object oriented program that I've written but I found the challenge to be very rewarding at the end. I also figured out how to load images(character design) after drawing them in Sketchbook. One thing I couldn't figure out though was how to draw the stars in a static position. I made a for loop to draw 100 stars in random locations but it continually ran every frame.
