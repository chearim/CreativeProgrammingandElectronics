# Ada

This week, I finally started to create my vision for my final project. 

Inspiration:

I started working on the code first, making sure I get a good reading on the temperature and soil sensors. The animated faces were definitely the hardest to code since the GFX graphics don't have many shapes or graphic details I could work with. After figuring that out, I started working on the body of the planter.

Inside, I assembled the wires and made sure there was ample space for the plant to fit.

Here's the finished product:

I decided to name my smart planter Ada as tribute to the adafruit library and becuase the name "Ada" means help. 

### Challenges 

Getting the faces to look realistic was a challenge especially since I was limited to 2 colors and minimal shapes. Assembling the planter so that the wires were all neat was also a bit time consuming but the end result was worth it :).
