# Final Project Idea

My mom loves her plants so I want to use this opportunity to help her raise them. I am planning to make a planter pet that cues to others if a plant needs more sunlight, more water, or just the opposite. This will all be signaled by an animated face using the lcd screen. For example, :) == perfect temperature and water ;( == needs more sunligh...and etc. If I have enough time I would also like to add wheels so that it can move to a more ideal enviornment if not taken care of right away. 

This is my inspiration: shorturl.at/deDW9

tools:
* temperature sensor
* soil moisture sensor 
* lcd screen 
* If I have more time.. 
  * wheels/motor 
  * ultrasonic sensor 
  * light sensor
