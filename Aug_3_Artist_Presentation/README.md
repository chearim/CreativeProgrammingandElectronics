# Design Presentation

My Presentation is on Rogue Fong, a very talented XR and installation designer. She emphasizes the importance of designing with empathy and working towards a good cause. After learning about her, I aspire to be just as compassionate and thoughtful as she is. 

My full presentation can be found in a zip file  under Aug_3_Artist_Presentation.
