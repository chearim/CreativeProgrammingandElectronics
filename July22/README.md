# Light Sensor 

For this assignment, I made a light sensor that read information from a photoreceptor and altered the intensity of 3 LED lights accordingly. As the environment got brighter, the LEDs would slowly turn on starting with the yellow one, then red, and then to green. Furthermore, once the brightness level reached its maximum value, the built in LED lights up. I could imagine this program being used to determine what spots around the house could be optimal for planting. It can also help visually impaired individuals figure out what spaces are well lit.

**Challenges**

As this was my first time using a breadboard, it was very difficult for me to figure out how to connect my circuit. I knew what to code in my program but drawing the schematic and assembling the components were a different story.
