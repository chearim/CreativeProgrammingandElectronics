# Game (The Journey) pt3 

For the final part of this game, I added a tactile button using arduino so that I can control my character without the use of my keyboard. Ever since I was little, I played with my gameboy so creating this project was very exciting!

**Challenges**

It was difficult at first to conduct serial communication between processing and arduino. I didn't realize, for example, that processing would print out the number of bytes I am using instead of the values in the serial monitor.
