# The Journey pt2

For the midterm, I decided to improve the game I built last week. I felt that I would learn more by working on the parts I couldn't figure out the first time instead of starting a new game.  

**Improvements**

I added a title page to introduce my game and instruct the user on how to play. I also managed to draw the stars so that the game is overall more aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, the player's score will be tracked and displayed at the end of the game. A restart option is also available when the game ends. 

Here is a gif of the game play.

**Challenges**
I wanted to randomize the obstacle locations however, that often led to them being overlapped and not allowing the character to land the jump. That is why I left the locations as they were. 

Originally, I wanted the stars to be in a static position but I actually like how they ended up moving to the left at different speeds.
