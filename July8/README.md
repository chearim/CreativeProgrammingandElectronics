# My Self Portrait

Hi, I'm a rising senior and proud bear at UC Berkeley. 

My favorite place to be is alone in my headspace while creating art. This includes paintings, user interfaces, plushies, etc. Of course, I may be accompanied by my dog or my favorit artists on spotify. I absolutely love seeing my thoughts unfold onto a canvas or take shape through the interlocking loops of my thread. The detials of every project is also something I enjoy fussing over. My own personal space with the windows wide open is the perfect place to do all of that.

A challenge I faced was readjusting the (0,0) coordinate in the upper left hand corner. I also wish there was a way to pin-point an exact coordinate using a ruler...perhaps there is a function for that.
