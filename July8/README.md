# My Self Portrait

Hi, I'm a rising senior and proud bear at UC Berkeley. 

My favorite place to be is alone with my thoughts while creating art. This includes paintings, user interfaces, plushies, etc. Of course, music and podcasts are essential in this environment as well. If it wasn't obvious already, my favorite color palette is pastelle~

A challenge I faced was readjusting the (0,0) coordinate in the upper left hand corner. I also wish there was a way to pin-point an exact coordinate using a ruler...perhaps there is a function for that.
