# Rose Portal 

As a cognitive scientist, I was always interested in optical illusions that are able to trick our highly complex brains. This is a video with some exmaples of famous optical illusions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHeYxzJFVKM). As you can see, our perceptions often doesn't match what is happening in reality. Subtle changes in light, colors, or patterns can also cause an art piece to look totally different. In my case, changing the stroke made an illusion of 4 petals stemming from the center. Because of this resulting design, I decided to choose rose related colors (red, pink, dark green). I also thought it looked like a portal opening up to another world, hence the title of my work.

**Rules:**
* Create a shape and make it grow in size

To do this, I made the shape's width/raidus into a variable and increased it repeatedly.

* Repeat these shapes one after another 

You can use a for loop to draw the same shape that decreases in size. 

* overlap the shapes 

Draw without calling the background again


**Challenges**
Loops are something I struggle with but this assignment helped me realize how useful they are. Without them, we would need to draw each shape individually. Transformations also make it easy to translate shapes and rotate the canvas.
