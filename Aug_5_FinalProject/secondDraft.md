# Final Project Idea

My mom loves her plants so I want to use this opportunity to help her raise them. I am planning to make a planter pet that cues to others if a plant needs more sunlight, more water, or just the opposite. This will all be signaled by an animated face using the lcd screen. For example, :) == perfect temperature and water ;( == needs more sunlight...and etc. If I have enough time I would also like to add wheels so that it can move to a more ideal enviornment if not taken care of right away. 

This is my inspiration: https://thehooksite.com/this-plant-pot-turns-your-plant-into-a-tamagotchi-like-pet-so-you-dont-forget-to-water-it/

### Challenges I may face 
I am most nervous about getting the lcd display to work as how I imagine it to. Similar to my inspiration video, I would like the animation to be responsive and quite detailed. I have looked up some tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KGMFhFQ0YY) already and will work on getting each animation working before connecting it to the sensors. After working on some projects, I realized that it's important to see if each compenent works separately before putting it all together. That way it'll be easy to find out where things went wrong. 


### Tools / Materials:
